# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture for Agent-Based Payment Collection System

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - January 15, 2024

## Context
We need to design a scalable, maintainable architecture for an agentic AI payment collection system that supports:
- Multiple communication channels (Email, Phone, SMS)
- Progressive escalation across channels
- Real-time customer interactions
- Integration with multiple external services
- High availability and fault tolerance

## Decision
We will adopt a **microservices architecture** with the following key design decisions:

### 1. Service Decomposition Strategy
- **Agent Services**: Separate services for Email, Phone, and SMS agents
- **Orchestration Services**: Campaign Manager and Agent Coordinator
- **Processing Services**: Context Engine, NLP Engine, Decision Engine, Transcription Engine
- **Integration Services**: Dedicated services for external API integrations
- **Platform Services**: Authentication, Logging, Monitoring, Configuration

### 2. Communication Pattern
- **Asynchronous messaging** using Apache Kafka for event streaming
- **Synchronous communication** using REST APIs for direct service calls
- **Message queuing** using RabbitMQ for task distribution
- **WebSocket connections** for real-time updates

### 3. Data Management
- **Database per service** pattern to ensure loose coupling
- **Shared data** managed through well-defined APIs
- **Event sourcing** for audit trails and state reconstruction
- **CQRS pattern** for read/write optimization

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Monolithic Architecture
**Rejected** because:
- Limited scalability for individual components
- Difficult to maintain with multiple teams
- Technology lock-in for the entire system
- Single point of failure

### Alternative 2: Serverless Architecture
**Rejected** because:
- Cold start latency unacceptable for real-time interactions
- Limited control over resource allocation
- Complex state management across functions
- Vendor lock-in concerns

### Alternative 3: Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
**Rejected** because:
- Heavier protocol overhead (SOAP/XML)
- More complex service discovery
- Less flexible deployment options
- Slower development cycles

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
✅ **Independent Scaling**: Each agent type can scale based on demand
✅ **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use optimal technology stacks
✅ **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't affect others
✅ **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can own different services
✅ **Deployment Flexibility**: Independent deployment and rollback capabilities
✅ **Easier Testing**: Smaller, focused services are easier to test

### Negative Consequences
❌ **Increased Complexity**: More moving parts to manage
❌ **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication overhead
❌ **Distributed System Challenges**: Eventual consistency, CAP theorem
❌ **Operational Overhead**: More services to monitor and maintain
❌ **Data Consistency**: Complex transaction management across services

## Implementation Guidelines

### Service Boundaries
```yaml
Agent Services:
  - email-agent-service
  - phone-agent-service
  - sms-agent-service
  - research-agent-service

Orchestration Services:
  - campaign-manager-service
  - agent-coordinator-service

Processing Services:
  - context-engine-service
  - nlp-engine-service
  - decision-engine-service
  - transcription-engine-service

Integration Services:
  - email-integration-service
  - phone-integration-service
  - sms-integration-service
  - crm-integration-service

Platform Services:
  - auth-service
  - notification-service
  - config-service
  - audit-service
```

### Communication Protocols
```yaml
Synchronous (REST):
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Configuration retrieval
  - Real-time customer queries
  - Health checks

Asynchronous (Events):
  - Customer interaction events
  - Campaign status updates
  - Performance metrics
  - Audit logs

Message Queues:
  - Task distribution to agents
  - Retry mechanisms for failed operations
  - Batch processing jobs
```

### Data Consistency Strategy
```yaml
Strong Consistency:
  - Customer profile updates
  - Financial transactions
  - Compliance records

Eventual Consistency:
  - Analytics and reporting
  - Performance metrics
  - Search indexes

Event-Driven Updates:
  - Cross-service data synchronization
  - Cache invalidation
  - Real-time notifications
```

## Compliance and Governance

### Service Standards
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs following OpenAPI specification
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response formats
- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and metrics endpoints
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication, HTTPS everywhere

### Development Standards
- **Code Quality**: Automated code reviews and quality gates
- **Testing**: Unit tests (>80% coverage), integration tests
- **Documentation**: Service documentation and API specs
- **Deployment**: Containerized deployments with Kubernetes

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Services (Month 1-2)
- Authentication service
- Campaign manager service  
- Email agent service
- Basic integrations

### Phase 2: Extended Channels (Month 3-4)
- Phone agent service
- SMS agent service
- Context engine service
- NLP engine service

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Month 5-6)
- Decision engine service
- Research agent service
- Advanced analytics
- Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Scale & Polish (Month 7-8)
- Load testing and optimization
- Advanced monitoring
- Multi-region deployment
- Documentation and training

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Service Availability**: 99.9% uptime per service
- **Response Time**: P95 < 2 seconds for critical operations
- **Throughput**: 10,000+ concurrent operations
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1% for business operations

### Business Metrics
- **Development Velocity**: 50% faster feature delivery
- **System Reliability**: 99% reduction in system-wide outages
- **Scalability**: Support for 10x customer growth
- **Maintainability**: 75% reduction in bug resolution time

## Review and Revision

This ADR should be reviewed:
- **Quarterly**: As part of architecture review meetings
- **Ad-hoc**: When significant performance or scalability issues arise
- **Before major releases**: To ensure alignment with system goals

**Next Review Date**: April 15, 2024
